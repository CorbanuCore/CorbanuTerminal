//! Window station and desktop access for the elevated sandbox's command
//! runner, and the commands it starts, outside the interactive window
//! station (#341, #345).
//!
//! A process that loads `user32.dll` attaches to a window station and desktop
//! when it starts; if it cannot open them, it dies with `0xC0000142`
//! (`STATUS_DLL_INIT_FAILED`) before running any code. `CreateProcessWithLogonW`
//! gives the new logon access to the interactive window station (`WinSta0`).
//! A Windows OpenSSH session (or a service) runs on a non-interactive window
//! station (`Service-0x0-<logon id>$`) that grants only the session's own user,
//! so there Core does it itself: it starts the runner suspended, gives the
//! runner's logon SID (not the sandbox user, which every sandbox logon on the
//! machine has) the least access a runner needs on this window station and
//! desktop, and resumes it. Once the runner has started its command, the
//! entries shrink to what the command and its children need to start: no
//! `WINSTA_CREATEDESKTOP`, and nothing on Core's desktop when they run on a
//! private desktop. They go when the runner exits.
//!
//! The commands hold the runner's logon SID, so what is left is theirs too;
//! nothing less lets them start. The runners Core starts from one logon
//! session share their logon SID, so while one runner starts, the commands
//! of the others hold its entries for that moment. No hooks, windows, menus
//! or clipboard either way.
