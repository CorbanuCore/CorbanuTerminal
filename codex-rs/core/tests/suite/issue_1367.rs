//! Issue #1367: the Aggressive/Moderate suites (#902) died once with a bare
//! SIGSEGV on macOS, before any test finished. The root cause is not
//! confirmed. This hardens one suspect: those suites run sessions on the
//! threads the test harness and Tokio spawn, whose stack is `RUST_MIN_STACK`
//! (8 MiB in CI, 2 MiB unless set), not the 16 MiB the product gives its
//! threads (`codex-arg0`) or the 32 MiB #553 needed. The test binaries now
//! raise that minimum to 32 MiB whatever the environment sets; these tests
//! fail if a thread spawned the way sessions' threads are gets less.

/// What sessions in tests need (#553, #1367). Spelled out here rather than
/// imported, so these tests still build, and fail, without the fix.
