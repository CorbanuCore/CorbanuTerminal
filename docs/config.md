# Configuration

Corbanu Terminal inherits Codex configuration but ships product-specific provider
defaults. Most users do not need to define model providers manually.

## Config Location

Corbanu Terminal reads config from `CODEX_HOME/config.toml`.

To select a product home explicitly:

```bash
export CORBANU_HOME="$HOME/.corbanu"
```

`PFTERMINAL_HOME` remains supported for legacy automation. If neither product
override is set, an explicit `CODEX_HOME` wins; otherwise Corbanu Terminal
prefers an existing `.corbanu`, reuses a lone `.pfterminal`, and defaults fresh
installs to `.corbanu`. This keeps product state separate from stock Codex.

## Built-In Providers

These providers are compiled into Corbanu Terminal:

| Provider id      | Display name   | Base URL                                | Env key              | Wire API         |

OpenAI uses Codex account login from `/providers` or `corbanu login`.
Provider API keys should normally be stored through onboarding, `/providers`,
or `/vault`. Corbanu Plan is activated or recovered through `/wallet`.
Amazon Bedrock uses cloud authentication, while Ollama and LM Studio use local
servers. Environment variables remain supported for temporary sessions and
automation.

Custom compatible providers can be added under `[model_providers.<id>]` in
`config.toml`. See [Models and providers](features/model-providers.md) for the
complete one-row-per-provider product inventory.

## Common Model Configs

Set a default provider and model in `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml`.

Ambient:

```toml
model_provider = "ambient"
model = "z-ai/glm-5.2"
```

OpenAI Codex account:

```toml
model_provider = "openai"
model = "gpt-5.6-luna"
```

DeepSeek direct:

```toml
model_provider = "deepseek"
model = "deepseek-v4-flash"
```

Z.AI:

```toml
model_provider = "zai"
model = "glm-5.2"
```

OpenRouter pinned DeepSeek Flash:

```toml
model_provider = "openrouter"
model = "deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731"
```

OpenRouter MiniMax:

```toml
model_provider = "openrouter"
model = "minimax/minimax-m3"
```

Baseten GLM:

```toml
model_provider = "baseten"
model = "zai-org/GLM-5.2"
```

Vercel GLM:

```toml
model_provider = "vercel"
model = "zai/glm-5.2"
```

Vercel GLM Fast:

```toml
model_provider = "vercel"
model = "zai/glm-5.2-fast"
```

Current Vercel AI Gateway models can use the same provider:

```toml
model_provider = "vercel"
model = "zai/glm-5.3-flash" # or zai/glm-5.3
```

The Vercel Kimi K3 and DeepSeek V4 Pro picker entries use provider-qualified
catalog identities so they remain distinct from the same slugs on OpenRouter:

```toml
model_provider = "vercel"
model = "vercel/moonshotai/kimi-k3"
# model = "vercel/deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro"
```

You can also select a model per run:

```bash
corbanu -m glm-5.2
corbanu -m gpt-5.6-luna
corbanu -m deepseek-v4-flash
corbanu -m deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731
corbanu -m zai-org/GLM-5.2
corbanu -m zai/glm-5.2
corbanu -m zai/glm-5.2-fast
```

The model picker maps these model slugs to the correct built-in provider.

## Vault And Secrets

Provider API keys saved by Corbanu Terminal are stored in the encrypted vault, not in
`config.toml`.

Vault labels:

```text
provider/anthropic_api_key
provider/ambient_api_key
provider/kimi_api_key
provider/zai_api_key
provider/deepseek_api_key
provider/openrouter_api_key
provider/model_api_key
provider/baseten_api_key
provider/ai_gateway_api_key
```

Do not put long-lived provider keys in `experimental_bearer_token` unless you
are intentionally running an automation-only setup. For interactive use, use
onboarding or `/vault`.

## Telegram Connector

`corbanu telegram` runs a Telegram long-polling connector that drives the
same in-process app-server harness as the terminal UI and `corbanu exec`.
Telegram-specific configuration is read locally by the connector from the
`[telegram]` table. Core accepts this table during strict config validation,
but the connector owns the individual settings.

For interactive setup, run `/telegram` in the TUI. Corbanu Terminal validates a
masked BotFather token into the encrypted vault, waits automatically for the
user to message the bot, asks which exact chat and sender to authorize, captures
the current model/workspace/permission settings, and starts the connector. The
bot remains silent until that authorization completes. Leaving the discovery
screen cancels its polling, and stale results cannot reopen the screen. The
same screen reports health and supports restart, stop, token replacement, and
full disconnect. A configured connector is restored when Corbanu Terminal starts;
an operation lock prevents multiple Corbanu Terminal processes from racing into two
pollers. The setup script below remains available for unattended hosts.

```toml
[telegram]
enabled = true
bot_token_env = "PFTERMINAL_TELEGRAM_TOKEN"
allowed_chat_ids = [21000038, -1001941234987]
allowed_user_ids = [21000038]
max_attachment_bytes = 10485760
media_retention_days = 7
max_media_store_bytes = 268435456
mode = "polling"
default_model = "glm-5.2"
approval_policy = "on-request"
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"
default_cwd = "/home/alice/corbanu-telegram"
webhook_url = ""
```

The bot token is never read from `config.toml`. Resolution order is:

1. The environment variable named by `bot_token_env`.
2. The encrypted vault label `telegram/bot_token`.
3. Startup error.

Connectors created through `/telegram` remove the token environment variable
from their child process so the just-validated vault credential cannot be
silently replaced by a stale shell value. `sandbox_mode` is connector-specific:
the TUI copies the permission mode shown at authorization time without changing
the global Corbanu Terminal sandbox.

Chats are default-deny. Only numeric Telegram chat IDs in `allowed_chat_ids`
can start turns. Private chats use that list directly. Group and supergroup chat
IDs are negative and additionally require the initiating user in
`allowed_user_ids`; group membership alone grants no authority. Approval buttons
are accepted only from an allowed user in the exact chat and forum topic that
owns the pending request. The setup script refuses a group chat without at least
one `--user-id`.

The connector stores recovered thread IDs and delivered item markers in
`$CODEX_HOME/telegram/state.json` so a restarted poller can resume the same
app-server threads without replaying the full transcript after lag recovery.
Per-conversation model and approval-policy overrides are stored in the same
file. A conversation is a chat plus its optional forum-topic ID, so two topics
in one group cannot share turns, model settings, or approvals.

Incoming updates first enter a bounded, bot-specific durable inbox at
`$CODEX_HOME/telegram/updates-<bot-id>.json`. The connector marks an update
complete only after app-server acceptance. Unapplied updates replay after a
restart with a deterministic client message ID, while completed IDs provide a
bounded duplicate filter.

Telegram messages use HTML parse mode, split outbound text at Telegram's
4096-character raw-text limit, and surface sensitive operations through inline
approval buttons rather than auto-approving them.

The Telegram command surface is:

- `/new` starts a fresh app-server thread.
- `/cancel` or `/stop` interrupts the active turn.
- `/status` shows the active thread and turn.
- `/model` shows the chat's active model/provider and the available model list.
- `/model <alias-or-slug>` saves the model for the chat and updates the current
  thread with `thread/settings/update` so subsequent turns keep the same
  history. Built-in aliases include `fable`, `opus`, `gpt`, and `gpt-5.5`.

  **`/model` selects a model, not a provider.** `model/list` does not report which
  provider serves each model, so the chat keeps the provider it already had except
  for the few model families whose provider is unambiguous from the slug (the
  Claude plan models, `gpt-…`, `glm-…`, `zai/…`). When the provider does not
  change, the reply says `Provider unchanged: <id>` rather than implying a switch.
  To change provider, set `model_provider` in `config.toml` and restart.

  Two selections are refused up front rather than failing at turn time: a model
  that is neither in the catalog nor a known alias, and a model whose provider has
  no reachable API key (checked against both the environment and the stored
  provider keys).

- `/approvals` shows the chat's active approval policy.
- `/approvals <untrusted|on-failure|on-request|never>` saves the approval
  policy for the chat and updates the current thread with
  `thread/settings/update`.
- `/compact` starts compaction for the active thread.
- `/diff` shows the git diff from `default_cwd` to the remote branch.
- `/skills` lists discovered skill names.

Ordinary follow-ups sent during a running turn use app-server steering. If a
turn temporarily cannot be steered, the connector holds up to 16 messages for
that conversation in FIFO order and shows the queue once. `/status` reports
`Idle`, `Working`, `Working · follow-ups queued`, `Awaiting approval`,
`Recovering queued input`, or `Blocked`, plus model, workspace, topic, queue
depth, the most recent successful Telegram contact or error, and the next useful
action.

Photos and image documents remain native image inputs. Supported non-image
documents (text/source, JSON, PDF, and XML/YAML) are downloaded into the
connector-owned media directory and described to the agent with their local
path, original name, MIME type, byte count, and SHA-256. The defaults accept up
to 10 MiB per file, retain media for seven days, and cap the media store at
256 MiB; configure those bounds with `max_attachment_bytes`,
`media_retention_days`, and `max_media_store_bytes`. Cleanup runs at startup and
during ingestion. Archives, executables, and unrelated binary media are
rejected rather than unpacked or implied to be available.

`default_cwd` is the workspace used for Telegram-created turns. Set it to the
directory where the agent should work, not to the Corbanu Terminal source tree or all
of `$HOME`. Codex automatically loads `AGENTS.md` from that workspace. The setup
script defaults fresh installs to `~/corbanu-telegram`, reuses an existing
legacy `~/pfterminal-telegram`, creates the selected directory, and seeds
`AGENTS.md` there from `codex-rs/telegram/dist/AGENTS.md.template` when the
workspace does not already have one. Use `--workspace "$HOME"` only when you
intentionally want a home-rooted remote agent workspace.

The recommended setup path is:

```bash
corbanu telegram --setup
```

Installed Corbanu Terminal packages bundle the setup script and service templates;
`--setup` locates and runs that exact packaged copy. From a source checkout,
`codex-rs/scripts/setup-telegram.sh --chat-id 21000038` remains available for
scripted setup.

The script prompts for the bot token without echoing it when neither the
process environment nor configured environment file provides one. For
unattended setup,
provide `PFTERMINAL_TELEGRAM_TOKEN` through the process environment without
placing the value in a command argument or shell-history line.

The script resolves `CODEX_HOME` the same way `corbanu telegram` does,
writes the token to `~/.config/corbanu/telegram.env` on fresh installs (or reuses
an existing legacy `~/.config/pfterminal/telegram.env`), writes or merges the
`[telegram]` block, sets `default_cwd`, and backs up an existing `config.toml`
before editing it. On reruns, the script only changes `[telegram]` settings that
were explicitly passed on that invocation or are missing from the existing file,
so operator tuning such as `approval_policy = "on-failure"` is preserved. Do not
pass the bot token on the command line; use `PFTERMINAL_TELEGRAM_TOKEN`, an
existing env-file entry, or the interactive prompt.

`corbanu -c telegram.foo=... telegram` and profile overrides do not override
`[telegram]` connector settings today. The connector reads this table directly
from `CODEX_HOME/config.toml`; use the config file or setup script for Telegram
settings. Core settings such as model, cwd, approval policy, and sandbox posture
still resolve through the normal core config after the connector has loaded its
own table.

On Linux, the connector emits one advisory startup warning when the resolved
sandbox policy is not `danger-full-access` and cheap host probes indicate the
sandbox is unlikely to launch: `bwrap` is missing from `PATH`,
`/proc/sys/user/max_user_namespaces` reads as `0`, or
`/proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_userns_clone` exists and reads as `0`, or
`/proc/sys/kernel/apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns` exists and reads as
`1`. The setup script also runs a live `bwrap --ro-bind / / true` probe when
`bwrap` exists. In a failing state, even simple shell commands can require
manual Telegram approval because the sandboxed launch fails before command
execution.

On a trusted single-user host where unprivileged user namespaces are unavailable,
set top-level `sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"` so the always-on connector
can execute commands without sandbox-launch approval churn. This disables the
filesystem sandbox, so do not use it on shared or untrusted hosts; install
`bwrap` and enable unprivileged user namespaces instead. The setup script never
writes this setting silently: pass `--allow-danger-full-access` or, on an
interactive TTY, confirm the prompt that states this disables the sandbox
globally for all Corbanu Terminal surfaces. In non-interactive mode without the flag,
preflight failure exits non-zero and does not write `sandbox_mode`.

At startup, the connector emits loud warnings when the effective approval policy
resolves to `never` or the effective sandbox resolves to `danger-full-access`.

To keep the poller always on, install the user service:

```bash
codex-rs/scripts/setup-telegram.sh --chat-id 21000038 --install-systemd
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now corbanu-terminal-telegram.service
```

The setup script runs `corbanu telegram --health` before installing a managed
service, then installs a concrete user unit: `ExecStart` is rewritten to the
absolute path returned by `command -v corbanu`, and `EnvironmentFile` is
rewritten to the actual `--env-file` path. The checked-in template remains
generic for review. The unit reads `CODEX_HOME` and `PFTERMINAL_TELEGRAM_TOKEN`
from the selected Telegram environment file, restarts automatically, and uses
`StartLimitIntervalSec=300` with `StartLimitBurst=5` so a persistent 409 conflict
from a second poller stops instead of restart-fighting forever. Run only one
poller per Telegram bot token.

Before enabling any service, run the local readiness probe:

```bash
corbanu telegram --health
```

It verifies the Bot API identity, non-empty authorization policy, group user
policy, writable state and workspace paths, the selected provider's known
credential requirement, and sandbox viability. It exits non-zero with the
failed boundary named.

On macOS, install the checked-in LaunchAgent through the same setup script:

```bash
codex-rs/scripts/setup-telegram.sh --chat-id 21000038 --install-launchd
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.corbanu.terminal.telegram.plist
```

On Windows, configure the connector first, verify it with
`corbanu telegram --health`, then install a current-user Scheduled Task:

```powershell
.\codex-rs\scripts\install-telegram-task.ps1
Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'Corbanu Terminal Telegram'
```

The task command contains no bot token; credentials remain in the Corbanu Terminal
vault. The task refuses duplicate instances and has bounded restart settings.

## Provider Overrides

Advanced users can still define custom providers under `[model_providers]`.
Prefer built-ins unless you need a different base URL, custom headers, or an
external bearer-token command.

Example custom OpenAI-compatible Chat provider:

```toml
model_provider = "custom-chat"
model = "some/model"

[model_providers.custom-chat]
name = "Custom Chat Provider"
base_url = "https://example.com/v1"
env_key = "CUSTOM_PROVIDER_API_KEY"
wire_api = "chat"
```

- Advanced configuration: <https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-advanced>
- Full reference: <https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-reference>

## Lifecycle Hooks

Admins can set top-level `allow_managed_hooks_only = true` in
`requirements.toml` to ignore user, project, and session hook configs while
still allowing managed hooks from requirements and managed config layers. This
setting is only supported in `requirements.toml`; putting it in `config.toml`
does not enable managed-hooks-only mode.
