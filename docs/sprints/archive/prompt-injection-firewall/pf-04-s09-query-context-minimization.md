# PF-04-S09 — Query-context minimization

## Execution mandate

- Deliver: Send only the explicit query and policy-approved minimum context to providers.
- Excludes: implementation owned by any plan feature other than `PF-04`.

## Plan linkage

- Plan: [Prompt-injection firewall and brokered authority](../../../plans/proposed/prompt-injection-firewall.md)
- Feature: `PF-04` — Search-provider broker and stable web-tool facade
- Acceptance advanced: Send only the explicit query and policy-approved minimum context to providers.

## Code boundaries

- Existing: `codex-rs/ext/web-search/src/`; `codex-rs/codex-api/src/search.rs`; `codex-rs/core/src/client.rs`
- Planned: `codex-rs/ext/web-search/src/broker/`; `codex-rs/protocol/src/web_research.rs`
- Tests: `codex-rs/core/tests/suite/web_search.rs`; planned `codex-rs/ext/web-search/tests/broker.rs`

## Preconditions

- [ ] The linked plan is active.
- [ ] Dependencies are completed: `PF-04-S08`.
- [ ] Worktree, branch, and base commit are exact and match the active plan.

## Done

- [x] Sprint record created, bounded, and linked to one plan feature.

## Remaining

- [ ] Remove implicit recent chat history from Moderate and Aggressive SearchRequest construction.
- [ ] Block portfolio, PNL, account ids, strategies, quarantined text, and protected fields.
- [ ] Capture provider requests in tests and assert only allowed query fields leave the process.

## Verification

- [ ] Focused final-tree command: `cd codex-rs && just test -p codex-web-search-extension && just test -p codex-core web_search`
- [ ] Regression fixtures for this sprint pass.
- [ ] TUI applicability: Not standalone; integrated key-driven proof is owned by PF-12-S06.

## Exit evidence

- [ ] Implementation commit and changed paths recorded.
- [ ] Final-tree test output and failure artifacts linked.
- [ ] Scope diff contains only `PF-04` work.
- [x] Cancelled unstarted and archived by product direction on 2026-08-24.
