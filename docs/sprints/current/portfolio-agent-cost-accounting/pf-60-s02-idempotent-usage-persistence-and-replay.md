# PF-60-S02 — Idempotent usage persistence and replay

S01 is archived; journal/quotation/storage/contributions/deletion are integrated.
Exact compact values are next. Reuse the clean idle worker checkout; its name
preserves history, not S01 ownership. Record actual dispatch HEAD separately.
[Current allocation](../../../research/agent-cost-accounting/compact-values-allocation.md).

## Execution mandate

- Next increment: pure exact compact-value codec/composition, no database mutation. Full S02 still owes compaction/retention, native owner/admission wiring and complete goldens.
- Excludes: Changing prices, rebilling historical customers, collecting prompts, restoring legacy Plan allowances, or silently converting allowance to cash.
- Budget proposal: 2–4 builder-days plus independent testing; not a commitment. Stop and re-slice if the bound is exceeded.

## Plan linkage

- Plan: [Unified agent cost and usage accounting](../../../plans/active/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting.md)
- Feature: `PF-60`; acceptance: Replay each fixture twice and after process restart; persisted and reconstructed totals equal the approved fixture exactly.
- Upstream/allocation: [plan record](../../../plans/active/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting.md#native-lifecycle-and-upstream-touch-record).

## Code boundaries

- Existing, read before work: `codex-rs/state/migrations/0041_provider_request_cache_usage.sql`; `codex-rs/app-server/src/request_processors/token_usage_replay.rs`; `codex-rs/tui/src/chatwidget/usage.rs`; `codex-rs/tui/src/token_usage.rs`.
- Planned output: front-matter paths only; lifecycle child registration and pure stored-amount/compact-value interfaces. No journal/storage/pricing behavior changes.
- Tests/evidence: new compact-values receipt; preserve earlier evidence. Native ABI, dependencies, production migrations and collectors excluded.

## Preconditions

- [x] Plan active under Travis's standing continuation authority; reservation transferred from completed S01, no fourth lane.
- [x] S01 accepted/archived after defaults approval, combined-tree fixture proof and independently reviewed technical handoff.
- [x] Exact worker/branch/base and four-file B1 scope match plan; parent must clean-fast-forward and record launch HEAD at dispatch.
- [x] Travis approved the default policy; synthetic/local tests only, no billing/live collection. Bound this allocation to one worker, at most 500 non-test lines, one independent review plus scoped corrections; no exhausted allowance reset.
- [x] Parent inspected DayTotals/Decimal visibility and amount/rate parsing distinction; current allocation linked above. New codec test passes pending.

## Done

- [x] First test-only journal and native SQLite regressions reviewed clean and integrated at c33d47f6c (worker 3f39d7a65); 202 state tests pass on combined tree. [Receipt](../../../../qa/portfolio/agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02/first-increment.md).
- [x] Real on-disk close/reopen, duplicate/reordered revision, rollback, concurrent writer, unknown/zero and partial Anthropic regressions pass; no process-kill or production claim.
- [x] Exact quotation e8ffdad4e reviewed clean and integrated at 486d2fb94; 214 state tests pass there. Prospective snapshots, exact arithmetic/half-even, unknowns and journal replay covered. [Receipt](../../../../qa/portfolio/agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02/exact-pricing-increment.md).
- [x] Immutable storage d898fbac0 reviewed clean and integrated at56295f668; all220 state tests pass there. Atomic snapshot/binding/evidence versions, corruption/reopen proof. [Receipt](../../../../qa/portfolio/agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02/estimate-storage-increment.md).

- [x] Contributions/deletion b08fff66d reviewed clean and integrated at3898eaa65;226 state tests pass there. Exact current totals, atomic all-version deletion/shared snapshot retention, deterministic serialization orders and two disk reopens; no simultaneous lock-contention/pruning/native owner claim. [Receipt](../../../../qa/portfolio/agent-cost-accounting/pf-60-s02/contribution-deletion-increment.md).

## Remaining

- [ ] Implement/test exact canonical stored amounts, all-seven-metric compact values and checked composition under the B1 allocation; no retention-service claim.
- [ ] Manager resolves daily/rolling expiry coverage, stale/unquoted source and late-import semantics before allocating any compaction mutation; no repeated defaults question.
- [ ] After reviewing the first increment, manager allocates production migration/dispatch/presence/price/retention wiring and complete S02 golden tests separately; do not broaden this worker's scope.
- [ ] Record actual outputs, counterexamples, remaining limitations and a concrete next-sprint handoff; stop on changed scope.

## Verification

- [ ] Current increment: compact_values::tests under runtime::accounting::pricing::storage::lifecycle plus lifecycle/storage/pricing/journal selectors, full state and normal-library check via pinned offline commands.
- [ ] Integration: from repo root, `python3 docs/plans/check.py; python3 docs/sprints/check.py`; `git diff --check`.
- [ ] Resolve TUI applicability against the plan; record actual-key success, failure/cancel, recovery/resume and final binary evidence for every affected interactive path.
- [ ] Record expected versus actual results and nonzero test counts; no unchecked assumption is converted into a pass.

## Exit evidence

- [ ] Output commit/digest and input provenance recorded; checks linked to that final artifact/tree.
- [ ] Named human/receiving owner accepts the bounded output; needed go/no-go decision is recorded.
- [ ] Handoff includes changed scope, contracts, known gaps and required combined-tree evidence.
- [ ] Done/Remaining ledgers updated honestly; archive accepted record under `docs/sprints/archive/portfolio-agent-cost-accounting/` and update plan backlinks.
